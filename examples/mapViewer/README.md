# MapViewer

This simple GBA project allows for viewing your converted Tiled maps.

## Usage

Once compiled, simply open the GBA binary using the emulator of your choosing. 
The directional pad of the GBA allows you to scroll through the map.

## Development

This project includes a Makefile, which allows you to build the required binaries.
There are a few build options:

- `make` will build a `mapViewer.gba`, which uses the generated code for the Tiled map.
- `make append` will build `mapViewer_append.gba`, which will append a `map.bin` (if generated by Tiled2GBA).
